\begin{frame}{The objectives}
\textbf{The objectives are:}
\begin{itemize}
\item to examine computational complexity of the algorithm;
\item 
to develop a software implementation of the algorithm where the most time-consuming operations are parallel;
\item to provide support for the arbitrary precision arithmetic;
\item to demonstrate how to use developed software for solving optimization problems of large dimension;
\item 
to inspect and test the code.
\end{itemize}
