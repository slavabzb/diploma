\subsection{The history of the EM algorithm}

\begin{frame}{EM proposed}
\begin{description}
\item[in 1976] by \textbf{Iudin and Nemirovsky} as a method of centered cross-sections.
\item[in 1977] by \textbf{Shor} as a method with space dilation in the direction of the subgradient.
\item[in 1979] by \textbf{Khachiyan} as a polynomial algorithm for linear programming.
